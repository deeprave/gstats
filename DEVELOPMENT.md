# gstats Development History

## Project Overview

gstats is a Git repository analytics tool built with Rust, evolving into a comprehensive system with async processing, memory management, and extensible plugin architecture. This document traces the development journey from its initial concept to the current implementation.

## Initial Foundation (Early Development)

The project started with core infrastructure to establish a solid foundation for Git repository analysis.

### Command-Line Interface

The first component implemented was a comprehensive CLI system using Rust's clap library. This provided structured argument parsing, validation, and help generation. The CLI supported various logging modes (verbose, quiet, debug) and output formats (text, JSON).

### Configuration System

A hierarchical configuration system was built using TOML format with automatic discovery. The system searches for configuration files in multiple locations (project directory, user home, system-wide) with a clear precedence order. Configuration sections allow environment-specific settings while CLI arguments provide overrides.

### Logging Infrastructure

A structured logging system was implemented with support for multiple destinations (console, file) and independent log levels. The system supports both text and JSON output formats with timestamp standardisation.

### Git Integration

Basic Git repository operations were implemented with path resolution, repository validation, and error handling. This provided the foundation for all repository analysis operations.

## Async Scanner Engine Development

The second major phase focused on building a high-performance async scanning system.

### Core Async Architecture

The scanner engine was built on tokio runtime with async/await patterns throughout. This established the foundation for non-blocking I/O operations and concurrent processing.

### Repository Interface

An async wrapper around Git operations was created, providing thread-safe access to repository data. This interface abstracted Git library details and provided consistent error handling.

### Multi-Mode Scanning

The scanner was designed to support different analysis modes: file system scanning, commit history analysis, code metrics calculation, security scanning, and dependency analysis. These modes could be combined using bitflags for flexible operation.

### Task Management

A sophisticated task coordination system was implemented to manage concurrent scanning operations. This included resource constraints, priority scheduling, and graceful shutdown capabilities.

### Streaming Data Processing

Rather than loading entire repositories into memory, a streaming approach was implemented. This allows processing of large repositories with constant memory usage through lazy evaluation and configurable batch sizes.

## Memory-Conscious Queue System

The third phase introduced advanced memory management and message processing capabilities.

### Message Queue Implementation

A specialised queue system was built using concurrent data structures (crossbeam) with memory tracking and backpressure handling. The queue supports versioned messages for forward and backward compatibility.

### Memory Monitoring

Real-time memory tracking was implemented with leak detection, usage history, and automatic garbage collection triggers. The system monitors both individual message sizes and total memory consumption.

### Adaptive Backoff

A pressure response system was created that automatically adjusts processing rates based on memory usage. This includes exponential backoff algorithms, batch size adjustment, and resource scaling.

### Event Notification System

A listener-based event system was implemented allowing components to subscribe to queue updates, memory pressure changes, and system events. This provides real-time monitoring and reactive behaviour.

### Consumer Threading

Background consumer threads were implemented to process messages asynchronously, with configurable batching and error handling. The consumers can be started, stopped, and reconfigured without interrupting the main scanning operations.

## Plugin Architecture Development

The fourth major phase introduced a comprehensive plugin system for extensibility.

### Core Plugin Traits

A trait-based architecture was designed with a base Plugin trait and specialised variants (ScannerPlugin, NotificationPlugin). This provides clean interfaces while enabling diverse plugin functionality.

### Plugin Registry

A central registry system was implemented for plugin lifecycle management. This handles registration, initialisation, execution, and cleanup with proper error isolation to prevent plugin failures from crashing the system.

### Async Communication

Plugin communication was built using async patterns with request/response enums. This enables flexible message passing while maintaining type safety and performance.

### Version Compatibility

A compatibility checking system was implemented to validate API versions and plugin dependencies. This ensures plugins can work safely with different system versions.

### Discovery System

Automatic plugin discovery was implemented with support for multiple plugin directories and metadata parsing. The system can find plugins in standard locations and load their descriptors automatically.

### Notification Framework

An async notification manager was created to broadcast system events to interested plugins. This includes rate limiting, preference filtering, and graceful shutdown handling.

## Built-in Plugin Implementation

Three reference plugins were developed to demonstrate the plugin system capabilities.

### Commits Plugin

The first plugin analyses Git commit history, extracting statistics about authors, commit patterns, and issue references. This demonstrates scanner plugin patterns and data aggregation.

### Metrics Plugin

A code metrics plugin was implemented to calculate complexity measures, file statistics, and quality indicators. This shows how plugins can process file system data and generate derived metrics.

### Export Plugin

A comprehensive export plugin was created supporting multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, XML, YAML, HTML). This demonstrates output plugin architecture and data transformation capabilities.

## System Integration

The final phase integrated all components into a cohesive system.

### Plugin-Scanner Integration

The plugin system was integrated with the async scanner engine through wrapper adapters. Plugin processing happens in real-time as scanning progresses, with proper backpressure handling and error isolation.

### Streaming Plugin Processing

Plugin execution was integrated into the scanner's streaming architecture. Messages flow through plugins as they are generated, enabling real-time analysis without buffering entire datasets.

### Main Application Flow

The complete application flow was implemented, connecting CLI parsing through configuration loading, plugin initialisation, scanner setup, execution, and result output. The system properly coordinates all components while maintaining async performance.

### Message Flow Architecture

A complete data flow was established: repository data flows through scanners to plugins to the message queue to consumers to final output. Each stage maintains async processing and memory efficiency.

## Current System Architecture

The current implementation consists of several integrated components:

**CLI System** handles user interaction, configuration loading, and plugin management commands.

**Async Scanner Engine** provides high-performance repository scanning with streaming data processing and task coordination.

**Memory-Conscious Queue** manages message flow with real-time memory monitoring and adaptive backpressure.

**Plugin System** enables extensible functionality through trait-based architecture with lifecycle management.

**Built-in Plugins** provide core functionality for commit analysis, code metrics, and data export.

The complete system processes Git repositories through an async pipeline: scanning generates messages that flow through plugins to queues to consumers to output formats. Memory usage is monitored throughout with automatic pressure response. Plugin processing happens in real-time during scanning without blocking operations.

## Development Progression

The development followed a clear progression from foundation to specialisation:

1. **Infrastructure** - CLI, configuration, logging, Git operations
2. **Async Scanning** - High-performance repository processing
3. **Memory Management** - Queue system with monitoring and backpressure
4. **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible functionality framework
5. **Reference Implementations** - Built-in plugins demonstrating capabilities
6. **System Integration** - Connecting all components into unified application

Each phase built upon previous work while maintaining architectural consistency. The async-first design established early enabled high performance throughout. The plugin system provides extensibility while maintaining system stability through proper error isolation.

The result is a Git repository analytics tool that can efficiently process large repositories while providing extensible functionality through a well-defined plugin architecture.
