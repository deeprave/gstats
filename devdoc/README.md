# Development Documentation

This directory contains detailed implementation plans and development documentation for the gstats project.

## Structure

- **`GS-{issue-number}_PLAN.md`** - Detailed TDD implementation plans for each YouTrack issue
- Each plan follows the same structure:
  - Overview and acceptance criteria
  - Step-by-step implementation with verification tests
  - Testing strategy and success criteria
  - Future enhancements and notes

## Workflow

1. Create implementation plan before starting any development
2. Follow TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) methodology strictly
3. Mark each step as completed with verification tests
4. Move YouTrack issue to "Queued" when plan is fully implemented
5. Keep plans as historical reference for project development

## Current Plans

- **GS-1_PLAN.md** - Rust Project Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-2_PLAN.md** - Initialize Git Repository and GitHub Integration ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-3_PLAN.md** - Validate Testing Infrastructure with TDD Workflow ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)

## Future Plans

Next implementation plans will be created here as new YouTrack issues are defined and development progresses.
