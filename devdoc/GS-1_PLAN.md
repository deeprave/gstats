# GS-1 Implementation Plan: Rust Project Infrastructure Setup

## Project: Git Repository Analytics Tool (gstats)
**YouTrack Issue:** GS-1 - "Establish Rust Project Infrastructure"  
**Date:** 25 July 2025  
**Phase:** Infrastructure Setup  

## Overview
This implementation plan establishes the foundational infrastructure for the gstats Rust project following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. While traditional TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) cannot be fully applied to infrastructure setup, we will use executable verification as our "test" criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Standard Rust project structure is established
- [x] Cargo.toml is properly configured
- [x] Hello World program compiles and runs successfully
- [x] Debug and release build targets are functional
- [x] Project can be built and executed using standard Rust toolchain

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Structure Setup
**Objective:** Create standard Rust project directory structure

#### 1.1 Create Core Directories
- [x] Create `src/` directory for source code
- [x] Create `tests/` directory for integration tests
- [x] Create `examples/` directory for example code
- [x] Create `benches/` directory for benchmarks (future use)

**Verification Test:** All directories exist and are accessible ✅

#### 1.2 Create Configuration Directories
- [x] Create `.cargo/` directory for project-specific cargo configuration
- [x] Create `target/` in .gitignore (will be auto-created by cargo)

**Verification Test:** Directory structure matches Rust conventions ✅

### 2. Cargo Configuration
**Objective:** Establish Cargo.toml with proper project metadata

#### 2.1 Create Cargo.toml
- [x] Write failing test: attempt to run `cargo check` (should fail - no Cargo.toml)
- [x] Create basic Cargo.toml with:
  - Package metadata (name, version, edition, authors)
  - Project description and repository information
  - License and keywords
  - Default binary target configuration
- [x] Run `cargo check` (should succeed - Green phase)

**Verification Test:** `cargo check` passes successfully ✅

#### 2.2 Configure Build Targets
- [x] Write failing test: attempt to build debug target (should work but verify output)
- [x] Configure debug profile settings in Cargo.toml
- [x] Configure release profile settings in Cargo.toml
- [x] Verify both targets build correctly

**Verification Test:** Both `cargo build` and `cargo build --release` succeed ✅

### 3. Hello World Implementation
**Objective:** Create and verify basic executable program

#### 3.1 Create Main Entry Point
- [x] Write failing test: attempt to run `cargo run` (should fail - no main.rs)
- [x] Create `src/main.rs` with Hello World implementation
- [x] Implement main function that prints "Hello, world!\n"
- [x] Run `cargo run` (should succeed and output correct text - Green phase)

**Verification Test:** `cargo run` outputs exactly "Hello, world!\n" ✅

#### 3.2 Verify Output Correctness
- [x] Write test script to capture and verify program output
- [x] Test debug build output: `cargo run` produces "Hello, world!\n"
- [x] Test release build output: `cargo run --release` produces "Hello, world!\n"
- [x] Verify exit code is 0 for successful execution

**Verification Test:** Program output matches specification exactly ✅

### 4. Build System Verification
**Objective:** Ensure all build targets work correctly

#### 4.1 Debug Target Verification
- [x] Write failing test: check for debug binary existence before build
- [x] Execute `cargo build` to create debug binary
- [x] Verify debug binary exists in `target/debug/gstats`
- [x] Execute debug binary directly and verify output
- [x] Verify debug symbols are present

**Verification Test:** Debug binary runs independently and produces correct output ✅

#### 4.2 Release Target Verification
- [x] Write failing test: check for release binary existence before build
- [x] Execute `cargo build --release` to create release binary
- [x] Verify release binary exists in `target/release/gstats`
- [x] Execute release binary directly and verify output
- [x] Verify binary is optimized (smaller size than debug)

**Verification Test:** Release binary runs independently and produces correct output ✅

### 5. Development Environment Setup
**Objective:** Configure development tools and CI readiness

#### 5.1 Create .gitignore
- [x] Create comprehensive .gitignore for Rust projects
- [x] Include target/, Cargo.lock (for binaries), IDE files
- [x] Verify git status shows only intended files

**Verification Test:** `git status` shows clean working directory with only source files ✅

#### 5.2 Create Development Scripts
- [x] Create basic build verification script
- [x] Script should test both debug and release builds
- [x] Script should verify output correctness
- [x] Make script executable

**Verification Test:** Build verification script passes all checks ✅

## Testing Strategy

Since this is infrastructure setup, our "tests" are verification commands:

1. **Structure Test:** `ls -la src/ tests/ examples/ .cargo/`
2. **Configuration Test:** `cargo check`
3. **Build Test:** `cargo build && cargo build --release`
4. **Execution Test:** `cargo run` and verify output
5. **Binary Test:** Execute binaries directly from target directories

## Success Criteria

The infrastructure setup is complete when:
- [x] All cargo commands execute successfully
- [x] Hello World program outputs exactly "Hello, world!\n"
- [x] Both debug and release binaries are functional
- [x] Project structure follows Rust conventions
- [x] Git repository is clean and properly configured

## Next Phase Preparation

Upon completion of this phase:
1. Commit initial project structure with message: "feat: establish Rust project infrastructure with Hello World"
2. Create first YouTrack issue for core library development
3. Begin TDD development of git repository analysis functionality

## Future Enhancements

### Universal Binary Support (Future Task - GS-3 or GS-4)
- **Objective:** Enable dual-architecture support for both ARM64 (Apple Silicon) and AMD64 (Intel) Macs
- **Approach:** Cross-compilation with `lipo` to create universal binaries
- **Implementation:**
  ```bash
  # Add targets
  rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin aarch64-apple-darwin
  
  # Build for both architectures
  cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin
  cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin
  
  # Create universal binary
  lipo -create -output target/universal/gstats \
      target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/gstats \
      target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/gstats
  ```
- **Benefits:** Single executable works on all macOS systems
- **Requirements:** CI/CD setup for automated universal builds

## Notes
- This phase focuses on infrastructure rather than feature development
- Traditional Red-Green-Refactor TDD will begin in the next phase
- Each step includes a verification test to ensure correctness
- All verification tests must pass before proceeding to the next step
- **Status:** COMPLETED - Issue moved to "Queued" state (ready for release)
