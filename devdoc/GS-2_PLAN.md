# GS-2 Implementation Plan: Initialize Git Repository and GitHub Integration

## Project: Git Repository Analytics Tool (gstats)
**YouTrack Issue:** GS-2 - "Initialize Git Repository and GitHub Integration"  
**Date:** 26 July 2025  
**Phase:** Repository Setup  

## Overview
This implementation plan establishes version control and GitHub integration for the gstats project. While traditional TDD cannot be fully applied to repository setup, we will use verification commands as our "test" criteria to ensure proper configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Local git repository is initialized and configured
- [ ] Initial commit includes all project infrastructure from GS-1
- [ ] GitHub repository is created and linked as upstream
- [ ] Local repository is synchronized with GitHub
- [ ] Repository is publicly accessible and properly configured

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Local Git Repository Setup
**Objective:** Initialize and configure local git repository

#### 1.1 Initialize Git Repository
- [ ] Write failing test: check for `.git` directory (should not exist)
- [ ] Run `git init` to initialize repository
- [ ] Verify `.git` directory was created
- [ ] Configure git user settings (if needed)

**Verification Test:** `.git` directory exists and repository is initialized

#### 1.2 Prepare Initial Commit
- [ ] Check git status to see untracked files
- [ ] Add all files to staging area with `git add .`
- [ ] Verify staged files are correct (no target/ or other ignored files)
- [ ] Review files that will be committed

**Verification Test:** All source files staged, ignored files excluded

### 2. Create Initial Commit
**Objective:** Create comprehensive initial commit with signed commits

#### 2.1 Create Signed Initial Commit
- [ ] Prepare comprehensive commit message
- [ ] Execute signed commit (user will do manually)
- [ ] Verify commit was created successfully
- [ ] Check commit log shows proper authorship and signature

**Verification Test:** Initial commit exists and is properly signed

### 3. GitHub Repository Creation
**Objective:** Create public GitHub repository and establish remote connection

#### 3.1 Create GitHub Repository
- [ ] Write failing test: check for remote origin (should not exist)
- [ ] Use `gh repo create` to create public repository
- [ ] Verify repository was created on GitHub
- [ ] Check remote origin was added automatically

**Verification Test:** GitHub repository exists and remote origin is configured

#### 3.2 Push Initial Code
- [ ] Set upstream branch to main
- [ ] Push initial commit to GitHub
- [ ] Verify code appears on GitHub
- [ ] Check repository settings and visibility

**Verification Test:** Code is visible on GitHub and properly synchronized

### 4. Repository Configuration Verification
**Objective:** Ensure repository is properly configured for development

#### 4.1 Verify Remote Configuration
- [ ] Check remote origin URL is correct
- [ ] Verify upstream tracking is configured
- [ ] Test fetch and pull operations
- [ ] Confirm repository access and permissions

**Verification Test:** Repository is fully synchronized and accessible

#### 4.2 Final Status Check
- [ ] Run `git status` to ensure clean working directory
- [ ] Verify local and remote are in sync
- [ ] Check GitHub repository settings and README display
- [ ] Confirm repository is publicly accessible

**Verification Test:** Repository is clean, synchronized, and publicly accessible

## Testing Strategy

Since this is repository setup, our "tests" are verification commands:

1. **Repository Test:** `ls -la .git` and `git status`
2. **Commit Test:** `git log --oneline` and signature verification
3. **Remote Test:** `git remote -v` and `git branch -vv`
4. **Sync Test:** `git fetch` and `git status`
5. **GitHub Test:** Repository accessibility and settings

## Success Criteria

The repository setup is complete when:
- [ ] Local git repository is initialized and configured
- [ ] Initial commit is created and signed
- [ ] GitHub repository is created and public
- [ ] Local and remote repositories are synchronized
- [ ] Repository is accessible at https://github.com/deeprave/gstats

## Suggested Commit Message

```
Initial commit: Establish Rust project infrastructure with TDD workflow

- Create complete Rust project structure (src/, tests/, examples/, benches/, .cargo/)
- Configure Cargo.toml with project metadata, build profiles, and binary target
- Implement Hello World program with verified debug and release builds
- Set up comprehensive .gitignore for Rust development
- Create build verification script with automated testing
- Establish development documentation structure in devdoc/
- Configure YouTrack integration with TDD workflow rules
- Add project management documentation and workflow guidelines

Infrastructure verified: all cargo commands functional, binaries tested,
development environment ready for feature development.

Refs: GS-1 (Queued)
```

## Next Phase Preparation

Upon completion of this phase:
1. Move GS-2 to "Queued" state
2. Create next YouTrack issue for core library development
3. Begin feature development with proper TDD workflow

## Notes
- This phase focuses on repository setup and version control
- Manual commit signing will be handled by user
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) will be used for repository creation
- All verification tests must pass before proceeding to next step
- **Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
