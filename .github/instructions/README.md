# Development Documentation

This directory contains detailed implementation plans and development documentation for the gstats project.

## Structure

- **`GS-{issue-number}_PLAN.md`** - Detailed TDD implementation plans for each YouTrack issue
- Each plan follows the same structure:
  - Overview and acceptance criteria
  - Step-by-step implementation with verification tests
  - Testing strategy and success criteria
  - Future enhancements and notes

## Workflow

1. Ask the user to select a task by it's issue id
2. Create implementation plan before starting any development
3. Follow TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) methodology strictly
4. Mark each step as completed with verification tests
5. Once all tasks in the implementation plan is fully implemented and marked as completed:
   before continuing, let's scan the source code and check for code quality issues, specifically:
   - scan all changed files and remove obvious/redundant comments, keeping only comments that:
     - document an API
     - provide editor or ide assistance or pseudo "bookmarks"
     - explain unusual logic, non-obvious or complex operations or algorithms
     - serve a purpose for the rust compiler, libraries or modules
   - Request confirmation from the user that the plan is fully implemented and working as intended
   - Attach the implementation plan to its respective issue
   - Move issue state to "Queued"
   - Go back to step 1

## Current Plans

- **GS-2_PLAN.md** - Initialize Git Repository and GitHub Integration ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-3_PLAN.md** - Validate Testing Infrastructure with TDD Workflow ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-4_PLAN.md** - Command Line Parser and Git Repository Detection ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-5_PLAN.md** - Implement logging ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-12_PLAN.md** - Configuration File Support ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-14** - Add repository path flag with --repo|-r|--repository option ✅ COMPLETED (Queued - Plan attached to YouTrack)
- **GS-6_PLAN.md** - Plugin Architecture System (Ready - GS-14 dependency resolved, GS-15 dependency required)

## Future Plans

Next implementation plans will be created here as new YouTrack issues are defined and development progresses.
