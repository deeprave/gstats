# Development Documentation

This directory contains detailed implementation plans and development documentation for the gstats project.

## Structure

- **`GS-{issue-number}_PLAN.md`** - Detailed TDD implementation plans for each YouTrack issue
- Each plan follows the same structure:
  - Overview and acceptance criteria
  - Step-by-step implementation with verification tests
  - Testing strategy and success criteria
  - Future enhancements and notes

## Workflow

1. Ask the user to select a task by it's issue id
2. Create implementation plan before starting any development
3. Follow TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) methodology strictly
4. Mark each step as completed with verification tests
5. Once all tasks in the implementation plan is fully implemented and marked as completed:
   before continuing, let's scan the source code and check for code quality issues, specifically:
   - scan all changed files and remove obvious/redundant comments, keeping only comments that:
     - document an API
     - provide editor or ide assistance or pseudo "bookmarks"
     - explain unusual logic, non-obvious or complex operations or algorithms
     - serve a purpose for the rust compiler, libraries or modules
   - Request confirmation from the user that the plan is fully implemented and working as intended
   - Attach the implementation plan to its respective issue
   - Move issue state to "Queued"
   - Go back to step 1

## Current Plans

- **GS-1_PLAN.md** - Rust Project Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-2_PLAN.md** - Initialize Git Repository and GitHub Integration ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-3_PLAN.md** - Validate Testing Infrastructure with TDD Workflow ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-4_PLAN.md** - Command Line Parser and Git Repository Detection ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-5_PLAN.md** - Implement logging ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-12_PLAN.md** - Configuration File Support ✅ COMPLETED (Queued)
- **GS-14** - Add repository path flag with --repo|-r|--repository option ✅ COMPLETED (Queued - Plan attached to YouTrack)
- **GS-24** - Core Scanner Infrastructure (Steps 1-8) ✅ COMPLETED (Open - Parked pending Step 9)
- **GS-31_PLAN.md** - CLI Filtering Flags Implementation ✅ COMPLETED (Queued - Ready for YouTrack attachment)
- **GS-6_PLAN.md** - Plugin Architecture System (Ready - GS-14 dependency resolved, GS-15 dependency required)

## Current Issue Status

### Completed Issues
- **GS-31**: CLI Filtering Flags Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
  - **All 9 implementation steps completed successfully**
  - Dependencies: GS-24 (Core Scanner Infrastructure) ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Key Features Delivered**:
    - Complete CLI filtering system with date, path, file, and author filters
    - Enhanced argument parsing supporting multiple formats
    - **BONUS**: Scanner configuration arguments with memory parsing
    - Comprehensive validation and error handling
    - Integration with GS-24 filtering infrastructure
    - 196 total tests passing (131 library + 65 CLI tests)
  - **Ready for YouTrack plan attachment and state update to "Queued"**

### Parked Issues  
- **GS-24**: Core Scanner Infrastructure (Open - Step 9 pending)
  - Steps 1-8: ✅ COMPLETED (76 tests passing)
  - Step 9: Integration and API finalisation (can proceed with GS-31 complete)
  - Comprehensive filtering system with zero-cost abstractions implemented

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ **COMPLETED GS-31**: CLI Filtering Flags Implementation with comprehensive functionality
  - All 9 implementation steps completed successfully
  - 196 total tests passing (131 library + 65 CLI tests)
  - **BONUS features**: Scanner configuration arguments with memory parsing (--performance-mode, --max-memory, --queue-size)
  - Memory size parsing supports units: 512MB, 1GB, 0.5T, 2048K, etc.
  - Complete integration with GS-24 filtering system
- ✅ Completed GS-24 Steps 1-8: Core scanner infrastructure with API versioning and filtering system
- ✅ Created GS-31 issue with comprehensive requirements in YouTrack
- ✅ Reorganised documentation structure to `.github/instructions/`
- ✅ Established proper issue tracking and dependency management

## Next Priority Items
1. **GS-24 Step 9**: Complete scanner integration and API finalisation (MEDIUM - Can proceed with GS-31 complete)
2. **GS-25**: Git Integration (next scanner component)
3. **GS-26-30**: Remaining scanner components
4. **New Features**: Ready to define next enhancement requirements

## Future Plans

Next implementation plans will be created here as new YouTrack issues are defined and development progresses.
